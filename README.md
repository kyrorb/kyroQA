# kyroQA: What are we?

**Ever ran out of past papers? So have I.**
It's a plague on society. You work so hard and you're on the brink of perfection. You open a generic past paper website...

**BOOM! You reached the bottom.**

You frantically search for some more. But that's it... You did them all.

# kyroQA: What are we going to do?

**We're going to develop a completely unique paper with new combinations of questions to always keep you on your toes.**

Additionally, you can track your progress with us and watch yourself blossom as you are challenged more.

Why would you not use us?
